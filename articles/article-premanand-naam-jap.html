						<p><br><br>Premanand Maharaj Ji is a famous spiritual guru who gives knowledge to people on how to live happy, peaceful, and devoted lives. He always teaches us that the best way to remember God is to chant his name with a pure heart instead of doing difficult worship. The easiest way to connect with God is to do nam jap, which means chanting any god's name again and again with faith and a pure heart. Premanand Ji Maharaj believes that in today's time people are so busy, and that's why they have no time to do difficult rituals, but by just chanting his name, people will never feel alone, stressed, or anxious.</p>

						<p><strong>📿<u>The Meaning of Naam Jap and Benefits:</u></strong></p>
					<p>Naam jap means chanting God's name many times with a pure heart and faith. For example: "Samb SadaShiv," "Radhe Radhe," and "Krishna Krishna." You have two choices: either chant in a loud voice or silently in your mind. It can be done anytime, anywhere, like at home during homework, while travelling, or even while cooking. Through naam jap our mind feels peaceful, happy, and stress-free.</p>

						<p><strong>🔱<u> What are the Spiritual Benefits of Naam Japa ?</u></strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Purify the soul: Maharaj Ji says that chanting God's name every time destroys past bad karma and makes us a better person day by day.</li>
							<li>Remove negative thoughts: according to Premanand ji, just by doing Naam Japa, your heart is clean. Remove jealousy, anger, fear, and sadness.</li>
							<li>Achieves everything: Premanand ji always says that you can achieve your goal by chanting Naam Jap.</li>
						</ul>

						<p><strong>🌺<u>Why does Premanand Maharaj Ji give more importance to naam jap than rituals?</u></strong></strong></p>
						<p>Maharaj ji says that rituals are not bad, but many people worship without real feelings. They offer flowers, Prasad, light lamps, or do a prayer, but their mind is thinking about other things. But these rituals did not bring real peace.</p>
						<p>On the other hand, when we just chant with pure heart &amp; faith for a few minutes, you feel connected directly to God. He always says that you don't need to give more time, spend money, or have special knowledge—just give only love and faith to God. That's why Premanand ji teaches us that the best worship is to remember God's name daily with love and a pure heart for becoming a gentle person and for having a happy life.</p>

						<p><strong> 🚩 <u>How to do naam jap correctly:</u></strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Sit comfortably</li>
							<li>Naam jap with love, not pressure</li>
							<li>Chant with your heart, not only your mouth</li>
							<li>If your mind wonders, bring it back</li>
							<li>Choose any God's name that you like</li>
							<li>Use any Naam Japa counter tool, like the Om Namah Shivay mantra</li>
							<li>Regular chant at least 5 minute</li>
						</ul>

						<p><strong>🕉️ <u>Real-life examples or devotee experiences of Nam Japa.</u>🔱</strong></p>

						<p><strong>1. Elvis Yadav promised to chant Radha naam:</strong></p>
						<p>The YouTuber Elvis Yadav recently visited Premanand Ji Maharaj in Vrindavan. When Premanand ji asked him if he practiced Naam Japa, he said, "No." Maharaj ji gently encouraged him to do naam jap for at least five minutes. Elvis Yadav promised that I will Jap Radha's Naam 10,000 times daily using a counter ring. This example shows how people are inspired by Premanand Ji all over the world, even if they are famous or influencers.</p>

						<p><strong>2. The story of a shopkeeper:</strong></p>
						<p>A small shopkeeper's business was going down. He was worried about how I fed my family. One day he went to satsang, where Premanand ji said, "Do your work with honesty and any God's Naam jap." Then he started to chant every morning before going to his shop—chanting "samb sadashiv." After a few months he felt that he focused on work, his mind became peaceful, and the customer was coming back. So he believes that you can achieve everything by doing nam jaap.</p>

						<p><strong>3.The story of Sunita Aunty from angry to peace:</strong></p>
						<p>Sunita aunty got angry quickly if someone spoke loudly; she spoke louder, and that's why she fought every day at home. One day her neighbors suggest, "Why not you japa 'Samb Sadashiv'?" She tried to chant while cleaning or cooking. In some time she felt that her anger was reduced, so she stopped shouting. Her family was shocked and asked how it happened, and then she said, "I didn't change myself; Shiv Naam changed me."</p>
